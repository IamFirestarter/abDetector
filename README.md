# Adblock Detector :no_entry:
Simple vanilla JavaScript AdBlock Detector.

[Try it out](http://nick.comlu.com/ab/)

### How to use it

  - Download/Clone the project, upload the file `abDetector.min.js`  
  - Put this in your `<head>`:
    - `<script type="text/javascript" src="abDetector.min.js"></script>`
  - Use this wherever you want to display a message to AdBlock users:
    - `<div id="ab-message" style="display: none">Your message here!</div>`
    
You're done!

### Notes
- If you really hate inline styles, you can still style the message in your CSS file.
- Since it's an element just like any other elements, you can do whatever you want with it (i.e. popups, imagesâ€¦)
